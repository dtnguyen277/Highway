/*
While programming this game I used new methods that I learned a lot and used new things that 
I had never done before. An example of this is the procedural obstacle generation I created.
Instead of respawning and recylcing obstacles. I used a stack where I pushed on new obstacles
spliced off old ones when they weren't needed. I also created a difficulty curve where the 
spawn frequency and speed of the road increased as you dodged more obstacles and slowed down
when you ran into obstacles.
